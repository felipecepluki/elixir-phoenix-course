Turn-based game where we'll have a player against the computer
Human and computer start with 100 hit points.
Each round, each can make one of 3 moves:
- Moderate attack dealing between (18-25) damage
- Ranged attack dealing between (10-35) damage
- Healing power, healing between (18-25) health

With each movement, what happened and the situation of each player must be displayed on the screen.
If the player or computer has 0 life, the game is over
If someone loses, when displaying the final result, it should not be displayed that a player has negative life.
The human player will be able to choose the name of his character, as well as the name of his 3 movements.
